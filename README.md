## Description 

*What, why, and how:* 

This is a back end for an e-commerce site. E-commerce has become the largest sector of the electronics industry. Because of this, as a full-stack web developer, I wanted to become familiar with the architecture of these platforms. It includes an Express.js API and uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
